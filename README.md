# Propositional Logic 
### Made in 24 hours for HackCMU 2022

Propositional Logic is a game about finding equivalent propositional formulas by creating chains of propositional variables and logical connectives using tiles on a grid.

The game is built in Godot, an open-source game engine that uses a Python-adjacent language, GDScript, for programming, and also has extensibility with C++ modules, a variety of plugins, C# support, and a lot of other cool things.

The main highlight of this project is the recursive parsing algorithm, which was written in order to quickly check equivalence for arbitrary chains of variables and connectives in real time.

Other highlights include the wonderful music (The Sea Has Returned) from ZeroRanger, one of my (Joshua's) favorite games, and the inclusion of the great and powerful John Mackey's visage.

An itch.io page running an HTML5 build is available at [Propositional Logic](https://jcharatcollins.itch.io/propositional-logic), but currently has some problems loading--we're working with support to get them fixed.
